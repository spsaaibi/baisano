Over the last 8 years of buiding Data Science and Machine learning teams, i've been compiling a framework to think about growth and structure of data scientists. I call it the **Data Science Competency Framework**, and it contains the following elements:

- A **set of competencies** that can be used to think about and evaluate growth and progress of Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers and Data Engineers.
- A career ladder for your Data Team.
- A scorecard to assign numerical scores to each of the competencies for members of your team.

In particular, these are the main competencies i use in this framework:

- Analytical Abilities
- Software technical mastery and autonomy
- Modeling and Algorithms
- Technical Leadership
- Build Data Products


The following slide deck presents the overall layout of the competency framework.

Do you have different ways to think about competencies of your Data teams? I'd love to hear about them!
