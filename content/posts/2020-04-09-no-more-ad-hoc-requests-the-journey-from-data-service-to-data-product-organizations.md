## Data Services or Data Products? The Dilemma that shouldn't be

Data teams represent an organizational transformation for most companies, and many companies today hire data scientists, data engineers and machine learning engineers. But which problems do data folks solve? Most of them take care of _urgent_ business requests, all day, every day. Do they work with engineering?
Do they focus on R&D until they build something _truly valuable_?

If this is you (or your team), are you doomed? Is there a way out? 

These are common questions for companies of all sizes, but there is embarrasingly little consensus of what to do about them. This typically forces data teams to react to incoming ad-hoc requests. No roadmap, no direction: just SQL queries.

Luckily, there is a way to turn traditional data service teams into an integral part of your business, while adding value with every single contribution. It implies a shift toward becoming a **data product team**, listening to internal and external customers, and building tools that increase operational efficiency and reduce the volumne of ad-hoc requests.

## Data Services

Under the data services paradigm (a model inherited from Business Intelligence), data folks create a backlog of equally important and **seemingly urgent** business requests. These are usually tackled in a first-in first-out basis. 

Every single workday, the role of the data service team is to gather data, clean it and deliver actionable insights to the business (this is easier said than done). 

This approach has a few advantages:

- A few _data pro's_ in your organization can answer any and all business questions.
- **Expertise compounds over time**: Answering similar questions becomes easier with each additional one.
- **Stakeholders have their go-to person/team**: Folks in the organization know who to go for when they want their business questions answered. There is no ambiguity or ambivalence of who _owns_ the responsibility of answering data questions.
- **Role and responsibilites are clear**: Data folks under this paradigm have very clear roles and responsibilities, since their objective is to minimize the time to respond to business requests, while delivering high quality answers. 

Despite these advantage, this approach falls short in the following ways:

- **Fails the "Winning the Lottery" test**: If a member of your team wins the lottery and decides to leave, you're stuck with a large knowledge void. Covering these knowledge gaps is extremely costly for companies of any size.
- **The analyst learns, but the organization doesn't**: Congrats, you have a data expert that can answer questions really fast! However, you're probably not documenting this knowledge for the entire organization to take advantage of it. By solving a problem, you've just created another one.
- **Your company depends on your data analyst**: This probably means this team get's multiple emails or tickets from everyone in the organization: From Finance, Marketing, Sales and even the CEO. This rapid-fire of requests makes it challenging for your team to have a clear path to grow.
- **Your data team is siloed**: Everyone comes to your team for data, but this is likely a unidirectional relationship. This creates an information silo, as well as less opportunities for members of your team to have a long lasting impact on your business.

Fortunately, there's a way to reap the benefits of this approach while reducing the downside on your organizational knowledge.

## A few strategies to build a Data Products Team

In short, what you need is to set up an environment where your data team has a central mission to build products that add value to your business, and they are not merely a group of mercenaries standing by to fulfill data requests coming from every side of your organization.

Your data team needs the space to build tools to do the following:

- **Answer their own business questions**: If they come up with a question, they should have the tools to answer it. By setting infrastructure to make this process fun and automated you'll empower your team to answer questions faster and more accurately.
- **Automate answering _common and recurrent_ business questions**: This will free a large percentage of your team's time, and allow them to focus their analysis skills on the thoughest business problems. This will also create a positive reinforcement loop with the business: Fast (and accurate) answers build trust and reliability.
- **Build and deploy self-service data tools**: Sounds like the holy grail, doesn't it? In reality, you can (and should) start small. Find a narrow (but important) business problem. Get to know the stakeholders, understand the frequency at which they need insights and data. Can you build and provide a reliable solution? Is it going to make their jobs faster/easier/better? Prepare a framework to measure and quantify the impact of using these self-service tools. Your data team develops and maintains a product that is constantly shaped and improved by feedback from your business counterparts.


## Outlook: How to get there?

Every organization is it's own different beast: There are no magic recipies for success. But every organization needs high quality data delivered to their stakeholders. **Data product teams** that work closely with business and product stakeholders have good chances of adding value to the business, answer critical business questions while building key internal products.
