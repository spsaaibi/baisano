Many companies today hire teams of data scientists, data engineers and machine learning engineers. But what do these folks do? Most of them take care of “urgent” business requests. If this is you (or your org), are you doomed? This talk presents practical advice to build scalable and effective data product orgs.

Data teams represent an organizational transformation for most companies. What problems do data folks solve? Do they work with engineering? Do they do R&D on the side until they build something really valuable?

These are embarrassingly common questions for most companies, from small startups to large Fortune 500 corporations. In the absence of good answers, data teams are left at the mercy of a myriad of business requests. No roadmap, no direction. Just SQL.

Luckily, there is a way to turn data service organizations into an integral part of your business, while adding value with every single contribution. It implies a shift toward becoming a data product team. It implies listening to internal and external customers, and building tools that increase operational efficiency and reduce the need for ad hoc queries.

On this post i’ll walk through practical steps you can take to achieve this on your organization. If you are a developer, data scientist, product stakeholder, manager or executive, this post is for you.
