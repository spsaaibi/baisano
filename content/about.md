My name is [Sebastián Pérez Saaibi](https://linkedin.com/in/spsaaibi) and I built and lead the Data Science and Machine Learning team at [Phreesia](https://phreesia.com). I have over a decade of experience using Data Science and Applied Machine Learning to solve **real world** business problems in industries such as Healthcare, Retail and Finance. I've had the opportunity to be an individual contributor, startup founder and technical manager throughout this journey.

I'm interested in building teams of Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers and Data Engineers to come up with products that solve complex organizational challenges, as well as mentoring technical managers and data scientists. I like good coffee, spending time with my family, running and [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17781840-sebastian-perez-saaibi).

I have a background in [Computational Science and Engineering](http://www.rw.ethz.ch/), [Physics](https://fisica.uniandes.edu.co/en/) and [Mechanical Engineering](https://mecanica.uniandes.edu.co/index.php/en/). In 2011 I co-founded [Aentropico](https://angel.co/aentropico), the first Predictive Analytics Startup in Latin America. I enjoy discussing entrepreneurship, data ethics and building effective data science teams, among other topics.
